# Rtools

This repository will house various utilities, tests,
and outstanding issues related to the upcoming
[Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
toolchain. The goal here is to encourage collaboration
and testing from various parties to ensure that a
patched version of this toolchain will be suitable for
use with an upcoming release of `R`.
