## Introduction

These notes describe the building of the gcc 4.9.2 compiler used on 
Windows for the R release 3.2.0.

## Installing cross-compiler

Installation was done using the scripts from Elance contractor
Doug R.  The full set of scripts are in [scripts.tar.gz](scripts.tar.gz).

On Linux VM, installed scripts to `~/Mingw-w64`.

Checked prerequisites:  
```
cd ~/Mingw-w64/
./check_prerequisites.sh
```
all results listed as installed.

Set `~/Mingw-w64/defaults` to
```
ROOT_DIR=$HOME/RtoolsStatic
BUILD_ARCHITECTURES=(x32)
USE_DWARF=no
USE_MULTILIB=no

PACKAGE_EXT=".tar.gz"
COMPRESS="tar --hard-dereference -zvcf"
DECOMPRESS="tar -xf"

export GNU_URL="ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/mirror/gnu"
GCC_LANGUAGES="c,c++,lto,fortran"

JOBS=1
CROSS_BUILD=`gcc -dumpmachine`

NATIVE_ARCHITECTURES=(x32 x64)
```

Built the cross compilers using
```
./build-linux-cross.sh --toolchain=toolchains/mingw-w64-gcc-4.9.2
./build-linux-cross.sh --toolchain=toolchains/mingw-w64-gcc-4.9.2 x64
```

then the native compilers using
```
./build-window-native.sh --toolchain=toolchains/mingw-w64-gcc-4.9.2.native
```

These take a few hours to run, and produce a number of tarballs in
`$HOME/RtoolsStatic/packages`; copies
of two of them are here:

  - Linux cross-compiler for 32 bit Windows output [linux32mingw32_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz](linux32mingw32_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz)
  - Linux cross-compiler for 64 bit Windows output [linux32mingw64_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz](linux32mingw64_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz)

The package files `mingw32mingw32_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz` and
`mingw32mingw64_gcc-4.9.2.toolchain.tar.gz` contain the 32 and 64 bit
native compilers that are included in Rtools.

## Building multilib version

This just doesn't work, as mentioned in the README.  Doug R. has
done some research into it, but neither of us has been able to get it all 
to work.

## Building the SEH version

This was done at first, but hasn't been tested with the latest version.  
The expectation is that 64 bit SEH will not work with static libs, but this
also hasn't been tested.
